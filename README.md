# Gemini Nano Experiments for Chrome

This repository contains tools and examples for experimenting with Gemini Nano in the Chrome browser. As of July 16, 2024, this project requires Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary (version 127 or higher).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install Chrome Dev or Chrome Canary (version 127 or higher).
2. Enable the following Chrome flags:
   - Set `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` to "Enabled"
   - Set `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model` to "Enabled BypassPrefRequirement"
3. Reload the browser.
4. Go to `chrome://components` and click "Check for Update" on "Optimization Guide On Device Model".

Note: It may take some time after the initial installation for the model to download and become available on your device.

### Verifying Setup

To verify that everything is working correctly:

1. Open the browser console:
   - Windows/Linux: `Shift + CTRL + J`
   - macOS: `Option + âŒ˜ + J`
2. Run the following code:
   ```js
   await ai.canCreateTextSession()
   ```
3. You should see:
   ```js
   'readily'
   ```
4. If you see other ouput you can navigate to `chrome://components`, look for "Optimization Guide on Device Mode" and click "Check for update". It might take some time for browser to download and enable the model, I left the browser for around an hour to do it's thing ;).
